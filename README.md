## Features

- Careful choice in fonts; monospace in the editor and semi-proportional in preview and UI
- Fonts have been base64 encoded, meaning you don't need to install them to use Typewriter
  - This means that the fonts used here are available on mobile
- Markdown formatting symbols are faded and shrunk, letting you focus on words instead
- Vim cursor support
- Long titles in the file explorer will soft-wrap
  - Useful for mobile and small displays
- Seamless embeds, without file titles
- Cool dark mode and warm light mode
- Compatibility with community plugins (see [Plugin Compatibility](#plugin-compatibility))
- Compatibility with Obsidian Hub
- Highlight on the active line for focus
  - Currently unavailable in v2.0.0 (Obsidian version 0.16.0 onwards)

<!--
- Multicolored highlights support (achieved through the use of inline color classes)
  - To use the multicolored highlights, use `<text class=orange>This is some orange text</text>`
  - See cover image for example (green highlight on "enabled by default")
  - *Current colors supported: green (light and dark mode), orange (light mode)*
  - available only in Reading Mode
- Clean preview without link colors or tags (achieved through YAML header `cssclass: nolink`)
  - available only in Reading Mode
-->
